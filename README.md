# Project Context
## Research Goal: 
Develop a computational framework to systematically study how social media ranking algorithms contribute to societal polarization through opinion dynamics modeling. The core insight is that existing opinion dynamics literature systematically conflates two distinct mechanisms: (1) how individuals update their opinions when exposed to new information (the update rule), and (2) which information individuals are exposed to in the first place (the selection rule). This conflation has made it impossible to isolate and study the specific effects of algorithmic curation on collective opinion dynamics.
## Methodological Contribution: 
The framework cleanly separates these mechanisms into two modular layers. The first layer implements classical opinion dynamics models (Voter, Bounded Confidence, DeGroot, Axelrod) that specify how agents update opinions given new evidence. The second layer implements selection rules that mimic social media ranking algorithms: random (baseline), highest/lowest opinion (engagement/narrative bias), and closest opinion (filter bubbles/homophily). This separation enables systematic exploration of the interaction space between update mechanisms and selection mechanisms - revealing which combinations amplify or dampen polarization, and under what conditions algorithmic effects dominate versus are negligible.
## Expected Impact: 
Rather than predicting the effect of a specific platform's algorithm, this framework provides the methodology to study any platform's design choices systematically. The work addresses a fundamental gap in computational social science: previous models cannot distinguish whether observed polarization stems from how people process information or from which information they see. By demonstrating that this separation is computationally tractable, theoretically meaningful, and reveals non-trivial interaction effects across multiple classical models, the framework enables future research to properly attribute polarization dynamics to their underlying mechanisms - informing both theoretical understanding and platform design decisions.
